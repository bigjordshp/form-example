Right side is 3 divs, flex-direction: column;

The middle section will be the most difficult in a way. This div needs an absolute position, so I
can position the header inside of it to the top left?
Other than that, I just need to flex wrap everything. On the widest of screens I should only have
2 inputs on a given row, going down to 1 based on screen size.

Left side, have a div overtop of the image, set the opacity, credit the img artist at bottom.
